//! Online (streaming) speaker diarization for live transcription.
//!
//! The offline pipeline in this module's parent sees the whole recording and can
//! cluster globally. During a live meeting we instead get one VAD speech segment
//! at a time and must label it immediately, so this keeps a running set of
//! speaker centroids: each incoming segment is embedded, compared against the
//! speakers seen so far, and either assigned to the closest one (updating its
//! centroid) or promoted to a new speaker.
//!
//! Online assignment is necessarily less accurate than the offline pass — it has
//! no view of the future and cannot revise past decisions. The "Speakers" action
//! on a finished meeting re-runs the full offline pipeline and supersedes these
//! labels.
